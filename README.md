# Temple of Reflection 🌿

![Temple of Reflection Banner](./public/images/temple-dark.png)

**Temple of Reflection** is a personal digital garden built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), designed as a space to collect and share ideas, notes, and reflections across four interconnected themes:

- 🎸 Music
- 🧘 Spirituality
- 🏛️ Society
- 💻 Tech

This site is not a blog in the traditional sense—it's a living archive that grows and evolves over time. It reflects an ongoing process of learning, questioning, and making sense of the world.
